# Music App

A music application designed to be a unified interface for managing, editing, tagging, and playing music.

## Roadmap

[ ] Create basic UIs for managing music.
[ ] Implement a music tagging UI in form of pop-ups/overlays.
[ ] Implement a music editing UI, possibly repurpose parts of software such as Audacity and Zrythm.
[ ] Determine how many features are feasible to be implemented in the given time period.
[ ] Cross compile all binaries to support Window, Mac, and Linux.
[ ] Create documentation for the project, using something such as mdbook.
