## Roadmap

- Create basic UIs for managing music.
- Implement a music tagging UI in form of pop-ups/overlays.
- Implement a music editing UI, possibly repurpose parts of software such as Audacity and Zrythm.
- Determine how many features are feasible to be implemented in the given time period.
- Cross compile all binaries to support Window, Mac, and Linux.
- Create documentation for the project, using something such as mdbook.
